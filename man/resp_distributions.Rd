\title{Compute response distribution indices}
\usage{
resp_distributions(x, min_valid_responses = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A dataframe containing survey responses in wide format.}

\item{min_valid_responses}{numeric between 0 and 1. Defines the share of valid responses
a respondent must have to calculate response quality indicators.}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame with response quality indicators per respondent.
}
\description{
Calculates response distribution indicators for multi-item scales
}
\details{
The functions assumes that the input data frame is structured in the following way:
\itemize{
\item The data frame is in wide format, meaning each row represents one respondent, each
column represents one variable.
\item The variables are in same the order as the questions respondents saw while taking the survey.
\item Reverse keyed variables are in their original form. No items were recoded.
\item All responses have integer values.
\item Missing values are set to \code{NA}.
}

The following response distribution indicators are calculated per respondent:
\itemize{
\item n_valid: number of within person valid answers
\item n_na: number of within person missing answers
\item prop_na: proportion of missing responses within respondents
\item ips_mean: within respondent mean over all items
\item ips_median: within respondent median
\item ips_median_abs_dev: within respondent median absolute deviation
\item ips_sd:   within respondent standard deviation
\item mahalanobis: Mahalanobis distance per respondent. Represents the distance
of observations from the center of a multivariate normal distribution.
