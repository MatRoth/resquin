\title{Compute response distribution indicators}
\usage{
resp_distributions(x, min_valid_responses = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing survey responses in wide format.}

\item{min_valid_responses}{numeric between 0 and 1. Defines the share of valid responses
a respondent must have to calculate response quality indicators. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with response quality indicators per respondent.
Dimensions:
\itemize{
\item Rows: Equal to number of rows in x.
\item Columns: 9, one for each response distribution indictator
}
}
\description{
Calculates response distribution indicators for multi-item scales or matrix
questions which have the same number of response options for many questions.
}
\details{
The functions assumes that the input data frame is structured in the following way:
\itemize{
\item The data frame is in wide format, meaning each row represents one respondent, each
column represents one variable.
\item The variables are in same the order as the questions respondents saw while taking the survey.
\item All responses have integer values.
\item Missing values are set to \code{NA}.
}

The interpretation of the indicators calculated depends on the whether response
data of negatively worded questions are reversed or not:
\itemize{
\item Do not reverse data of negatively worded questions if you want to assess
average response patterns (Dunn et al., 2018).
\item Reverse data of negatively worded questions if you want to assess whether
responses are distributed randomly or not with respect to an assumed
latent variable (Marjanovic et al., 2015).
}

The following response distribution indicators are calculated per respondent:
\itemize{
\item n_valid: number of within person valid answers
\item n_na: number of within person missing answers
\item prop_na: proportion of missing responses within respondents
\item ii_mean: intra-individual mean
\item ii_median: intra-individual median
\item ii_median_abs_dev: intra-individual median absolute deviation
\item ii_sd:  intra-individual standard deviation
\item ii_var: intra-individual variance
\item mahal: Mahalanobis distance per respondent.
}

Intra-individual response variability indicators (ii_sd, ii_var) have been
proposed to measure insufficient effort responding (Dunn et al., 2018) and to
distinguish between random and conscientious responding (Marjanovic et al, 2015).
ii_median_abs_dev is added as a robust alternative.

Intra-individual location indicators can be used to asses the average location
of responses on a set of questions (ii_mean, ii_median).

Mahalanobis distance is a outlier detection indicator. It represents the distance
of a participants responses from the center of a multivariate normal distribution
defined by the data of all respondents.

\examples{
# A small test data set with ten respondents
# and responses to three survey questions
# with response scales from 1 to 5.
testdata <- data.frame(
  var_a = c(1,4,3,5,3,2,3,1,3,NA),
  var_b = c(2,5,2,3,4,1,NA,2,NA,NA),
  var_c = c(1,2,3,NA,3,4,4,5,NA,NA))

# Calculate response distribution indicators
resp_distributions(testdata) |>
    round(2)

# Include respondents with NA values by decreasing the
# necessary number of valid responses per respondent.

resp_distributions(testdata,
                   min_valid_responses = 0.2) |>
    round(2)
