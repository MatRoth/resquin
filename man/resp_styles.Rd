\title{Compute response style indicators}
\usage{
resp_styles(x, scale_min, scale_max, min_valid_responses = 1, normalize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing survey responses in wide format.}

\item{scale_min}{numeric. Minimum of scale provided.}

\item{scale_max}{numeric. Maximum of scale provided.}

\item{min_valid_responses}{numeric between 0 and 1. Defines the share of valid responses
a respondent must have to calculate response style indicators.}

\item{normalize}{logical. If \emph{TRUE}, counts of response style indicators will
be divided by the number of non-missing responses per respondent. Default is
\emph{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with response style indicators
per respondent.
\itemize{
\item Rows: Equal to number of rows in x.
\item Columns: Five, one for each response style indicator.
}
}
\description{
Calculates response style indicators for matrix questions or multi-item scales.
}
\details{
Response styles capture systematic shifts in respondents response behavior.
\code{resp_styles} is aimed at multi-item scales or matrix questions which use the same number of
response options for many questions.

The functions assumes that the input data frame is structured in the following way:
\itemize{
\item The data frame is in wide format, meaning each row represents one respondent,
each column represents one variable.
\item The variables are in same the order as the questions respondents
saw while taking the survey.
\item Reverse keyed variables are in their original form. No items were recoded.
\item All responses have integer values.
\item Questions have the same number of response options.
\item Missing values are set to \code{NA}.
}

The following response style indicators are calculated per respondent:
Middle response style (MRS), acquiescence response style (ARS), disacquiescence
response style (DARS), extreme response style (ERS) and
non-extreme response style (NERS).

The response style indicators are calculated in the following way
\itemize{
\item MRS: Sum of mid point responses.
\item ARS: Sum of responses larger than midpoint.
\item DARS: Sum of responses lower than midpoint.
\item ERS: Sum of lowest or highest category responses.
\item NERS: Sum of responses between lowest and highest respnose category.
}

Note that ARS and DRS assume that the polarity of the scale is positive. This
means that higher numerical values indicate agreement and lower numerical values
indicate disagreement. MRS can only be calculated if the scale has a numeric midpoint.

Also note that the response style literature is fragmented (Bhaktha et al., 2024).
Response styles calculated in \code{resquin} are based on van Vaerenbergh & Thomas (2024).
However, we used the name non-extreme response style (NERS) instead of mild response style,
to emphasize that NERS it the inverse of ERS. Both appear in the literature
(for a NERS example see Wetzel et al. (2013)). Consult literature in your field
of research to find appropriate names for the response style indicators calculated here.

# A test data set with ten respondents

# Include respondents with NA values by decreasing the
# necessary number of valid responses per respondent.

# Get counts of responses attributable to response styles.
