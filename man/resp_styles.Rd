\title{Compute response style indicators}
\usage{
resp_styles(x, scale_min, scale_max, min_valid_responses = 1, normalize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing survey responses in wide format.}

\item{scale_min}{numeric. Minimum of scale provided.}

\item{scale_max}{numeric. Maximum of scale provided.}

\item{min_valid_responses}{numeric between 0 and 1. Defines the share of valid responses
a respondent must have to calculate response style indicators.}

\item{normalize}{logical. If true, counts of response style indicators will
be divided by the number of non-missing responses per respondent.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with response quality indicators per respondent.
}
\description{
Calculates response style indicators for multi-item scales
}
\details{
Response style indicators are ...
\code{resp_styles} is aimed at multi-item scales which use the response options for
many questions.

The functions assumes that the input data frame is structured in the following way:
\itemize{
\item The data frame is in wide format, meaning each row represents one respondent,
each column represents one variable.
\item The variables are in same the order as the questions respondents
saw while taking the survey.
\item Reverse keyed variables are in their original form. No items were recoded.
\item All responses have integer values.
\item Questions have the same number of response options.
\item Missing values are set to \code{NA}.
}

The following response style indicators are calculated per respondent:
\itemize{
\item MRS: Middle response style (only if scale has a numeric midpoint)
\item ARS: Acquiescence response style
\item DRS: Disacquiescence response style
\item ERS: Extreme response style
\item NERS: Non-extreme response style
}
